# Implementation
The python code contains implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Given an unidrected weighted graph and a start vertex, the algorithm calculates shortest path from start vertex to all other vertices and checks if that is a unique path. I have implemented priority queue using a bianry heap.

## Example
![alt text](https://github.com/AlishaShahane/Unique-Shortest-Path-Using-Dijkstra/blob/master/Example.png)

There is a unique shortest path from start vertex s to x and y.
However the path from s to u and v is not unique.
